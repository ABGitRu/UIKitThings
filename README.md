# UIKitThings

A collection of practical UIKit demos and examples demonstrating various UIKit behaviors, patterns, and best practices for iOS development.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains hands-on demonstrations of UIKit concepts that every iOS developer should understand. Each demo is designed to be self-contained and focuses on a specific aspect of UIKit development.

## üéØ Purpose

- Understand core UIKit behaviors and lifecycle events
- Explore common patterns and edge cases
- Provide reference implementations for typical scenarios
- Help developers transition from SwiftUI to UIKit (or vice versa)

## üìÇ Demos

### View Lifecycle
- **ViewController Lifecycle** - Understanding `viewDidLoad`, `viewWillAppear`, and related methods
- **View Hierarchy Management** - Adding, removing, and managing subviews

### Layout & Constraints
- **Auto Layout Basics** - Programmatic constraint creation
- **Layout Lifecycle** - `layoutSubviews`, `setNeedsLayout`, and `layoutIfNeeded`
- **Safe Area Handling** - Working with safe area insets

### Performance & Optimization
- **Rendering Performance** - Understanding draw cycles and optimization techniques
- **Memory Management** - Proper cleanup and avoiding retain cycles

### Custom Components
- **Custom Views** - Building reusable UIView subclasses
- **Custom Controls** - Creating interactive UIControl elements
